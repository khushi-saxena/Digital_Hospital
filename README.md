In these times of social distancing healthcare is the foremost domain that needs to be available online, without compromising quality. And this project is a step towards that.
The main feature is the power of development with the help of which we have created a website with the help of which doctors can view the reports of patients and can prescribe accordingly.
It has separate interfaces for both doctors and patients, with features like review patient reports, display patient details, create appointments, chat function with patient group and email facility to contact patients for doctors and updating of reports, contacting doctor through email and chat feature for patients.

This solution simplifies the prediction process for doctors with enhanced accuracy and also eases the work for both patients and doctors.

Also as the Covid19 scenario has forced everything to be online and from distance, this platform provides both the doctors and their patient groups a seamless healthcare experience.
